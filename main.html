	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is the amount of time taken by the algorithm with respect to the amount of input provided. An algorithm is said to be efficient if its time complexity is low.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of space taken by the algorithm with respect to the amount of input provided. O(n) is said to be a good amount for space complexity.</p>
